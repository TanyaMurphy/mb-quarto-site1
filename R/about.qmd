## About this site

This site is a collection of queries and analyses on the MusicBrainz database, focusing on drummers and their contributions to music that has received popular and critical acclaim. The data is sourced from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database), a community-maintained open music encyclopedia that collects music metadata and makes it available to the public as relational tables.

## Main queries

Given the vast number of songs, albums, artists and related data catalogued by MusicBrainz, artists, albums, and songs are limited those linked to series that are popular and critical acclaim lists of music and artists. 
My series were then further filtered to include only those related to major music awards and lists in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia. The inclusions and exclusions are somewhat arbitrary and you can help refine the definition of 'popular and critical acclaim' and the inclusion and exclusion criteria by submitting a [GitHub issue](). 

```{sql, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

SELECT id_series, series_name, series_comment, series_type_name,
    series_type, ordering_type, entity_type, parent, child_order,
    series_type_description
    FROM myseries
    WHERE (series_name LIKE '%Billboard%' or series_name LIKE '%Juno%' 
        or series_name LIKE '%Grammy%'
        or series_name LIKE '%Rolling Stone%' 
        or series_comment LIKE '%SPIN magazine%' 
        or series_name LIKE '%Academy Awards%'

        or series_name LIKE 'Brit Award%') 
      AND NOT entity_type = 'event'
   ORDER BY entity_type, series_name;
